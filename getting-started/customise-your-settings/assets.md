# Tracking & Untracking Assets

### **Add Tracked Assets**

Adding tracked assets is a way of telling the protocol to track assets that it doesnâ€™t already know about. By default, new assets are automatically tracked when you trade. However, you may want to add tracked assets to your Vaults which are obtained through other methods such as an airdrop or yield farm. This drop-down allows you to do that.

### Remove Tracked Asset

If you have added an asset with a zero balance or a balance of less than 0.01 WETH and would like to remove it, you can do so here. However, you cannot remove the denomination asset.

It is important to note that if you are not tracking assets, they will not be reflected in the GAV which may create an arbitrage opportunity for some investors.

As a Vault Manager, it is your responsibility to manage these nuances.
