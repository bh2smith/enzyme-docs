# Deposits & Withdrawals

### Deposits

A key feature for both builders and managers is that if configured in such a way, Enzyme vaults can accept depositors. Those depositors will receive tokenized deposits known as vault shares.

Depositors can connect a wallet via the connect button on the top right hand side of the app.

Once connected, click the `Deposit` button in the top right corner of the Vault's page and follow the instructions from there signing approve and deposit transactions as guided.

Once you've completed either process above and the `Deposit` transaction is successfully mined, you are officially a vault token-holder. The app will take a moment to reflect the changes. See the [risks & nuances](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-M17sAWG26bbHj7WurKa/s/WzXrybpj5e9VBbPlbYCJ/\~/changes/238/general-info/risks-and-nuances) section before depositing.



### Withdrawals

Withdrawing from a Vault is relatively easy. Once connected with your wallet, go to the `Withdrawal` button and sign the transaction.
