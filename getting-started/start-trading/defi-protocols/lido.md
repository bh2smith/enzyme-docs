## Lido Finance on Enzyme

Lido stands at the forefront of decentralized staking solutions, facilitating seamless staking of Ethereum, and Polygon tokens. It pools user tokens to stake with network validators and issues stTokensâ€”representatives of the staked assets plus the staking rewards. Users hold stTokens to participate in network validation rewards, which increase their stToken balance over time. Unstaking is as straightforward as staking: users burn their stTokens and enter the network's withdrawal process to receive their stake plus rewards.

Enzyme's integration with Lido currently supports the withdrawal of stETH, meaning users can redeem their staked ETH via Lido and engage with the withdrawal waiting period as prescribed by the network's conditions.

### Lido Withdrawal Period

The duration of the withdrawal period is subject to various factors:

* **Queue Volume**: Withdrawals follow a First-In-First-Out system; the larger the stETH queue, the longer the wait.
* **Validator Pool Performance**: The 'Bunker mode' can slow down the process in times of network stress.
* **Beacon Chain Exit Queue**: Validators must fully exit before releasing funds, with wait times increasing with more concurrent exits.
* **Staking Activity**: The interplay between staking and unstaking affects the speed of withdrawal fulfilment.
