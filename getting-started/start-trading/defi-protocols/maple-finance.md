Deposits to this Maple pool are locked for 90 days. If you make another deposit to this pool before the 90 days are up, the counter will restart based on a weighted average of your deposits. For example, if you deposit $10m on day 1 and another $10m on day 45, your lockup period on $20m will be 60 days at the time of the second deposit. After this lockup period is finished, you may withdraw your funds via a two-step process. You can read more about the process [here](https://maplefinance.gitbook.io/maple/protocol/liquidity-providers/how-can-i-add-or-withdraw-liquidity#withdraws).
