# Asset Disallowed list

An asset disallowed list enables a vault owner to specify assets from the asset universe which are "off limits". Nobody can trade these assets from within the vault whilst they are on this list. This is a useful policy to use if you want to disallow assets with low quality price feeds being held in the vault. This can lead to inaccurate NAV pricing and possible arbitrage risk. See[ risks & nuances](../../../general-info/risks-and-nuances.md) section for more information on this.
