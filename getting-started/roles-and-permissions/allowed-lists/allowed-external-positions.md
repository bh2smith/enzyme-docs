# Allowed External Positions

An external position is similar to an adapter integration in that it allows you to interact with external DeFi protocols. However, they differ in that they are not represented by a liquid, divisible, fungible token (eg. Compound CDPs or Uniswap v3 LP positions, Maple Lending, Aave Borrowing and Convex Voting). This policy defines which external position “types” can the vault interact with. Selecting external positions on this policy means that your vault will only be able to interact with external positions on this list.



Note that if a vault is able to interact with external positions, it increases trust assumptions and introduces the potential for some risks.
