# Vault Owner

The Vault Owner has the highest level of admin control and access. They can grant (or remove) permission to third parties to trade on behalf of the vault. These permissions can be extremely limited or extrememely flexible depending on the permissions granted. The way to limit what a delegated trader can or can't do is by assigning policies. The policies can either be set when creating the vault or added at a later date.
