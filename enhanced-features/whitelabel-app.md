### **How does it work?** <a href="#c3f7" id="c3f7"></a>

Good question! We have created a step-by-step demo video that guides you through the entire process which you can watch below.

There are two prerequisites required to create the whitelabel page.&#x20;

1. You need to have a vault. If you haven’t yet created a vault, you can follow the steps to create one in this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PL9sTJuru4\&t=365s) (‘create a vault’ starts at 6:05).
2. You need to have an Enzyme account. If you haven't yet created an account on Enzyme you can sign up for an account [here](https://app.enzyme.finance/sign-up).

Once you meet this criteria, you can proceed to create your personalised whitelabel page.



First, you need to go to ‘My Account’, scroll down the page and select the ‘My Pages’ box.

You will see a button labelled, ‘**Create Page**’. Click on this and it will enable you to name the page, insert a custom subdomain and choose the vault you want this page to be allocated to. If you have more than one vault, all of these vaults will be visible in the ‘**Choose Vaults**’ dropdown menu, so be sure to select the correct vault that you would like to whitelabel.

Once you have populated the form with the page name, subdomain and chosen vault, select ‘Create Page’. This will take you back to your account page where you are now able to edit your chosen vault via the ‘My Pages’ box.

Simply click on the “Customise” button and you will be redirected to your custom vault page.

Here you have the ability to change your logo, update your background and customise the theme and colour palette of the vault display page itself. This opens up a range of new possibilities for vault managers that want to create a clear point of difference and better attract and nurture potential investors.
