# Monitoring Your Vaults

Keeping track of deposits into your Vaults is easy, and starts again at the **Dashboard**. On the `My Deposits` tab, you can see the total value of all your investments in Enzyme products charted (once you've held shares long enough for there to be data), as well as a table with your positions broken out individually. You can also find your Deposit History, which shows when you've bought and sold shares.

If you have not created an account, you can still browse the various vaults in which you own shares if you are connected to the app with the wallet that owns those shares. In the left-hand column, or on mobile in the menu that opens from the top right corner, there is a `My Vaults` section that allows you to look at each of your vaults individually. There is no aggregated view without an account, however.
