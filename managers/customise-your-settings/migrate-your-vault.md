# Migrate your Vault

![](../../.gitbook/assets/up\[grade.png)

If you want to opt-in to a new release of Enzyme you can do so by migrating to the latest version. We will never force you to do this. However, we will not maintain old versions for longer than a fixed period which will be communicated through our official channels. From this drop-down, you will be able to accept and execute your vault migrations.
