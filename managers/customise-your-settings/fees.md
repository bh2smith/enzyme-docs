### Gas Relayer

Enabling the gas relayer allows your vault to pay for the gas of certain transactions. You may only hold up to 0.2 ETH in the Gas relayer.

When disabling the gas relayer, the funds held by the gas relayer will return to the vault.

### Auto Buyback Protocol Shares

This option enables you to claim your protocol fee discount in an automated fashion. See [#enzyme-protocol-fee](../../what-is-enzyme/background.md#enzyme-protocol-fee "mention")section for more details about how the fee is applied.

To encourage vault managers to pay the protocol fee in MLN, shares are minted at 50 bps of AUM but can be bought back using $MLN at only 25 bps of AUM ie at a 50% discount.&#x20;

By enabling the Auto Buyback Protocol Shares option your vault can take advantage of paying the lower rate of 25 bps all in one transaction.&#x20;

Youâ€™ll need to have $MLN available in your vault to atomically buy back the full amount of protocol fee shares collected during deposits and shares redemption actions.
