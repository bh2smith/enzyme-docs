# Change Owner

![](../../.gitbook/assets/change\_owner.png)

There may be some use-cases where youâ€™d want to change the vault owner (eg. moving it to a multi-sig, retiring with a succession plan, etc). In that case, you can use this form to change the vault owner. Ownership transfer is a 2-step process. First, nominate a vault owner using this form. To complete the vault ownership change, the nominated vault owner will need to claim the ownership of the vault. Once the ownership change is claimed, you will lose all owner privileges for this vault.
