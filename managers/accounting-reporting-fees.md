## Overview

Your Vault GAV updates in real-time on Enzyme. In other words, you can transparently track historic prices in a provable way. Your performance track record is extremely valuable if you want to scale and monetise.

## Portfolio

Here you can check your positions, which are updated in real-time, including the handling of deposit subscriptions, redemptions, trading, lending, pools and derivatives.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Enzyme allows you to track up to 20 assets in your portfolio, this limit is due gas costs. You can always track or untrack new assets from Settings > Asset Managment > Tracked Assets.

## Financials

## **Fees**

![](<../.gitbook/assets/fees (3).png>)

We talked about fees in the [Set Up](setup/) section. Once you deploy your Vault to main-net, the protocol is continuously calculating and accruing any fees which are owed to the Vault Manager. Typically you'd need a team of expensive accountants or auditors to do this job but this feature is automated and embedded natively in Enzyme's contract logic.

There's more! The Enzyme contracts also enable you to claim your payout as it accrues. To this, just go to your Fee tab in your Vault Menu and scroll down to the Claim Fees section.

Here you will also have an overview of the total Gas, the total Expense Ratio, and the Protocol fees.

## **Policies**
