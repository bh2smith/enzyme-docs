Delegating is a separate action from locking: you don't need to delegate if you lock, nor do you need to lock if you delegate. However, if it is the first time you are Delegating, you will need to Lock your CVX first before delegating.

### How To Lock Your CVX?

1\. In your left-hand vault menu, go to “DeFi Protocols” and select Convex.&#x20;

2\. Click on the ‘Lock/Delegate’ tab.&#x20;

3\. If you have CVX available balance, click on ‘Lock’.&#x20;

4\. Input the amount of CVX you wish to lock and click on ‘Lock’.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your CVX will be locked for 16 weeks + the time between when you lock your CVX and the next epoch start, which is every Thursday at 00:00.
{% endhint %}

### **How To Delegate CVX?**

1\. In your left-hand vault menu, go to “DeFi Protocols” and select Convex.

2\. Click on the ‘Lock/Delegate’ tab.&#x20;

3\. At the bottom of the screen click on ‘Delegate’.&#x20;

4\. You may delegate to voting or to a particular address.

{% hint style="info" %}
You might receive many different tokens when delegating to Votium. In this case, the gas cost to claim rewards may be higher than the actual rewards. Considering this scenario, it might be better if you delegate votes to your own address and vote yourself.
