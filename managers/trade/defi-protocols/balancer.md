[Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that provides automated market making (AMM) services on the Ethereum blockchain and other Layer 2 networks. It allows users to create and manage custom pools of tokens, where they can earn fees by providing liquidity to the market. Balancer is designed to be a more flexible and customizable alternative to traditional AMM platforms like Uniswap.

Balancer Pools contain two or more tokens that traders can swap between. Liquidity Providers put their tokens in the pools in order to collect swap fees.&#x20;

\
Now vaults can provide liquidity to Balancer Pools and stake their Balancer Pool Tokens with Balancer.
