# Delegated Voting

Enzyme allows governance token holders to be able to vote. This would be done by delegating the voting power to another wallet address.

Currently, you are allowed to delegate and undelegate **$UNI**, **$COMP**, **$AAVE** and **$stkAAVE**.

{% hint style="info" %}
By delegating **$AAVE** or **$stkAAVE**, you are delegating both Voting and Proposition.
{% endhint %}
