[Pendle](https://www.pendle.finance/) Finance is a decentralized finance protocol that specializes in the trading and management of tokenized future yields on Ethereum. It achieves this innovative approach by allowing users to separate ownership of the underlying yield-bearing asset from its future yield, creating tradable PT tokens. These PT tokens represent the future yield of various decentralized finance tokens and can be traded, leveraged, or hedged to optimize investment strategies.

This integration enables vault managers to engage in several key activities within the Pendle ecosystem directly from their Enzyme vaults. The integration allows vault managers to:

1. **Swap Stablecoin PT Tokens:** Vault managers can deposit or withdraw different PT tokens based on their assessment of market conditions and yield optimization strategies.
2. **Provide Liquidity on Pendle Pools:** By providing liquidity to Pendleâ€™s pools, vault managers not only contribute to the market's depth but also earn transaction fees and additional rewards.
3. **Claim PENDLE & other Incentives from Liquidity Provision:** Rewarding active engagement within the Pendle Finance ecosystem.

This integration ensures that vault managers have access to all PT tokens whose underlying assets are part of the Enzyme asset universe, thereby broadening the scope for sophisticated investment maneuvers and enhanced portfolio performance.
