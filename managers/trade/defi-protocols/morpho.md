# Morpho

[Morpho](https://morpho.org/) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that aims to optimize the efficiency of lending and borrowing on Ethereum. It does this by combining the peer-to-peer efficiency of lending pools with the flexibility of lending markets. Mrpho Optimizers are gateways to existing lending protocols, such as Compound and Aave, that offer improved interest rates and liquidity.

[Enzyme](https://enzyme.finance/) is excited to introduce Morpho Optimizers. With this integration, vaults can now fine-tune their lending strategies by leveraging the most efficient protocols available. This allows for seamless supply and borrowing of assets, exploiting deep liquidity within the Ethereum ecosystem.
