# Review

Once you've configured your Vault settings, you'll be presented with a summary of the choices you've made. Take a careful look through and when you are satisfied, accept the [Terms and Conditions](https://enzyme.finance/terms) and click on the Create button to start the transaction signing process. After the transaction has been mined, you will see a buy shares button on the top right of the screen. From here, you will be able to invest in your vault with the denomination asset or [seed](seed.md) it with a pre-existing portfolio.

Important. If you already have a portfolio of assets that you want to migrate over to an Enzyme Vault, see next section on how you can potentially do this in a more cost effective way.
