# Account

In this release, we have introduced Enzyme Accounts. Now, Vault managers can register an account that allows for an aggregate view of all vaults they manage in one central place. Soon after this release we will enable push notifications whenever you have a new vault subscriber, redeemer, or simply an activity of which you would like to be notified.

Accounts are strictly optional.

## My Account

If you click on your name on the top right corner of your screen, you will see your account details. You can also add wallets to your account here. Adding wallets to your account allows for aggregated views of both your performance as an investor in Enzyme vaults, as well as all of the vaults that you manage.

## Security

Here you can improve the security of your account, which we highly recommend. You can set up a Multi-Factor Authentication, adding an extra layer of security to your Enzyme account, and please make sure you backup your codes.

## **Settings**

Here you can personalize and manage your account. From updating your avatar, changing your email address and your name or username, to adding your social media links and website.
