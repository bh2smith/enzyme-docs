<summary><strong>How was Enzyme founded?</strong></summary>

The Enzyme Protocol, formerly known as the Melon Protocol, was initially developed by the private company Melonport. Melonport was funded through a token sale, and after the dissolution of the company, the Melon Protocol was transferred to the Enzyme Council. This transition was announced in a blog post titled "[Goodbye Melonport, Hello World](https://medium.com/enzymefinance/goodbye-melonport-hello-world-a64b5d116b13)".

</details>

## **Fees, Performance & Accounting**

<details>

<summary><strong>What are the fees for using Enzyme app?</strong></summary>

Enzyme implements a Protcol Fee, which is charged by minting additional vault shares to an Enzyme Council owned contract. Initially applied at 50 bps of AUM but can be bought back by the vault manager for 25 bps.

The Enzyme Council owned shares can be bought back in the equivalent value of $MLN, either by the vault manager at 25 bps or by the Enzyme Council at 50 bps.

The $MLN is then burned. The “50% discount” encourages the vault manager to take care of this process rather than the Council having to. The protocol fee is charged each time that a fund:

* Receives a deposit
* Have shares redeemed
* Migrates to a new release or reconfigures vault settings without migrating.

A more detailed discussion of the mechanics of the protocol fee can be found [here](https://avantgarde-finance.gitbook.io/enzyme-protocol-v4-sulu-general-spec/topics/protocol-fee).

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>How is the Enzyme platform governed?</strong></summary>

Enzyme's governance model is centered around user control and protection. Users have permissionless access to a secure asset management protocol, and are safeguarded from malicious actors. The Enzyme Council, which is responsible for making decisions that protect user interests, ensures that users can benefit from continuous innovation and improvements while still maintaining control over the software they use.

Although the Enzyme Technical Council (ETC) owns and controls the ENS subdomains pointing to the latest contracts, users decide which version of the protocol to base their business on. However, it is highly encouraged for users to always use the latest version of the protocol to avoid security vulnerabilities. Ultimately, users have the sole responsibility for choosing and upgrading the software they use, and are encouraged to conduct their own analysis and review of the contracts they intend to use.

You can find read more about the Enzyme Council, [here](https://docs.enzyme.finance/governance/the-enzyme-council).

As of now, Enzyme does not support trading futures and options. However, the Enzyme team is continuously evaluating and researching potential new features and asset classes to add to the platform in the future. So while it is not currently available, it may be added at a later time. We recommend staying tuned for any updates or announcements regarding new features.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What are the supported wallets for accessing Enzyme?</strong></summary>

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>How does asset pricing work in Enzyme?</strong></summary>

Enzyme's asset pricing system works by normalizing or canonicalizing all assets to ETH first through the [ValueInterpreter](https://specs.enzyme.finance/architecture/release#valueinterpreter). This is because it is not feasible to maintain direct conversions between all asset pairs. Once assets are normalized to ETH, they can be converted to USD using the ETH/USD price. This means that displaying asset prices in ETH involves one less conversion step, as compared to using another currency.

However, if the Chainlink oracle is a USD oracle, there is an additional conversion step required for assets priced in USD. For example, TOKENX/USD pair would need to be converted to TOKENX/ETH via the ETH/USD rate, and then to TOKENX/\[your chosen display currency].

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What are the requirements to add new assets to the Enzyme Asset Universe?</strong></summary>

To add new assets to the Enzyme Asset Universe, there are several requirements that need to be met.

First, the assets need to have a valid onchain price feed and have substantial liquidity within the Enzyme integrated decentralized exchanges (DEXes). Once these criteria are met, the assets need to pass Enzyme's internal security checks to ensure they meet the platform's high standards for safety and security.

After that, the assets will be presented to the Enzyme Council for a vote to be added to the Asset Universe. Only after passing all these steps can an asset be added to the Enzyme Asset Universe.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>How to request the addition of a new token?</strong></summary>

To request the addition of a new token, you can contact Enzyme through social media or email at [**support@avantgarde.finance**](mailto:support@avantgarde.finance). However, you must ensure that the token meets the Enzyme Asset Universe requirements, including having a valid on-chain price feed and substantial liquidity within Enzyme-integrated DEXs. Additionally, the token must pass Enzyme's internal security checks and be approved by the Enzyme Council.

<summary><strong>What is the ValueInterpreter?</strong></summary>

The ValueInterpreter is a component of Enzyme protocol responsible for aggregating various "price feeds" that are used to calculate the value of input assets in terms of an output asset. It serves as a central point of aggregation for these feeds, which are an additional type of plugin managed by the Enzyme Council.

The Enzyme protocol distinguishes two categories of assets: "primitives" and "derivatives." Primitives are assets for which there are direct rates via Chainlink aggregators that can be used to convert one primitive to any other. Examples of primitives include WETH, ZRX, etc. Derivatives, on the other hand, are assets for which there are only rates in terms of underlying assets. Examples of derivatives include Chai, Compound cTokens, Uniswap pool tokens, etc.

The ValueInterpreter determines whether an asset is a primitive or a derivative and executes the corresponding logic to use the appropriate price feed(s) to calculate the value of input assets in terms of the output asset.
