# What is Enzyme?

Enzyme is an easy-to-use DeFi asset management system that funds, investment clubs, DAO treasuries and companies can plug into. It simplifies interaction with DeFi by acting as an aggregator of protocols and making your asset management experience seamless.&#x20;



The high customisability of Enzyme means you can use it to build pretty much anything in DeFi. This is why we like to think of it as a DeFi Operating System.  If the interface doesn't cater for your use case, most likely the smart-contracts do. Avantgarde Finance offers services to companies building in DeFi. If it's not immediately obvious how it can be useful to you, [get in touch](https://app.gitbook.com/u/cNJyWoq7JFfSPTKZZVaS6XQUv7u2) with Avantgarde Finance about your use case and let us show you.
