# Security

Enzyme’s smart contracts are fully tested and independently audited before any main-net deployments are made. Most recently, the [Sulu release](https://github.com/enzymefinance/protocol) (v4) was [audited](https://github.com/enzymefinance/protocol/tree/v4/audits) by [ChainSecurity](https://chainsecurity.com) and [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com) amongst others, with a [current bug bounty of $400’000.](https://immunefi.com/bounty/enzymefinance/)&#x20;
