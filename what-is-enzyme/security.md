# Security

Enzyme’s smart contracts have been on main-net since early 2019. The contract are fully tested and independently audited before any main-net deployments are made. The most recent [Sulu release](https://github.com/enzymefinance/protocol) (v4) was [audited](https://github.com/enzymefinance/protocol/tree/v4/audits) by [ChainSecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/) and [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) amongst others, with a [current bug bounty of $400’000.](https://immunefi.com/bounty/enzymefinance/) In addition to that, the [Enzyme App](https://app.enzyme.finance/) has been fully audited and is on constant scrutiny.
