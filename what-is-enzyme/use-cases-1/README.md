# Asset Management

Enzyme allows anyone to build, scale and monetise investment strategies using  non-custodial and highly configurable vaults. These strategies can be restricted to completely on-chain DeFi-native protocols and tokens or can be broadened out to include off-chain assets.  As a vault creator, you can take advantage of the various building blocks offered by Enzyme without needing to have any software engineering background. You can benefit from the following features;

* Automation tools
* The ability to handle tokenized deposits known as vaults
* Flexible and configurable architecture: add rules, roles & permissions to your vault configuration selecting from a wide range of available options.
* A large growing array of DeFi connections (eg. lending, borrowing, liquidity provision, derivatives, farming)
* A token asset universe (200+ tokens and growing rapidly)
* The options to charge fees to depositors (eg. management fee, performance fee, entrance fee, etc)
* Roles & Permissions such as:
  * Granting trading access to one (or more) individual(s)
  * Creating allowed lists and disallowed lists of protocols and assets that can (or can't be traded)
  * Defining who can or can't deposit into your vault.
  * Grant who can deposit to your strategy and on what terms (eg. minimum deposit, limited access to family and friends, etc)
  * Assigning slippage or P\&L stop losses to various traders or bots who are managing assts
* In-built accounting tools to report back to depositors in real-time
* A suite of advanced risk management tools





Importantly, a Vault Owner on Enzyme can be defined as either;

* an Ethereum wallet address&#x20;
* or an Ethereum multi-sig or a DAO governance contract
