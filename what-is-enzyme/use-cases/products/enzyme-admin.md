# Enzyme Admin

## Overview

Use Enzyme Admin to automate fund administration on-chain and support DeFi products on your fund admin platform.



Enzyme Admin is the fastest and most cost-effective way to operate and administer fund activity in DeFi. Your free Enzyme administrator account allows you to configure fund roles & permissions from an easy to navigate dashboard. It also enables you to access data you need for streamlined NAV calculation, calculation & distribution of fund fees and any fund activity that you need to track.

\


### **Benefits of Enzyme Admin:**

* Support DeFi funds or DeFi fund activity quickly
* Reduce internal cost burden
* No need to build and maintain your own in-house infrastructure
* Full transparency into fund activity and streamlined APIs
* Control over certain behaviors with the use of roles & permissions
* White labeling tools enable own-branded display of fund data

\


### Access Enzyme Admin directly from your fund admin platform

Use Enzyme as your chosen service provider for Client’s DeFi activity and service your client’s DeFi needs overnight from your existing fund administration platform.

* Pay an annual B2B subscription to Enzyme for unlimited usage of the platform
* Integrate Enzyme API’s into your platform&#x20;
* Support DeFi funds or fund activity overnight
  * Roles & permissions&#x20;
  * DeFi data in real time (staking, borrowing, lending, etc)
  * Policies to prevent malicious activity (flash loan attacks, misappropriation of funds)
  * Calculate and claim fund admin fees automatically via our smart-contracts



### Roles & Permissions

Clearly define roles & permissions within the protocol. Define in smart-contract code who is allowed to trade on behalf of the fund and what they can and can’t do. More on this here.

### Policies

Misappropriating funds in DeFi through manipulation is fairly easy to do. By using Enzyme policies, you can build in a P\&L stop-loss or cumulative slippage tolerance threshold to ensure no misappropriation of funds. These can always be overridden by the fund administrator but assure you that no honest (or dishonest) mistakes can be made. More on this here.

### NAV & Fees

Enzyme Admin calculates the NAV of a fund in continuous time on-chain. The NAV is provable and verifiable via on-chain data and proofs. As a result, we are also able to automate the calculation and distribution of management and performance fees. Fund administrators can leverage our fee splitter contract to assure they are paid in basis points out of a management fee in real-time. This massively reduces the burden involved and the running of any tech infrastructure in-house.

### White label

Enzyme provides white labeling solutions for funds to be able to display their performance and fund data in real time. These interfaces can be customized with their own branding and spun up in a matter of minutes. More on this here.

### APIs available for Enzyme Admin

Enzyme Admin provides APIs for making crypto deposits and withdrawals to your Enzyme DeFi account across supported blockchains. It also provides APIs for NAV calculation, fee calculation, investment and redemption history, all transaction history and much much more.

### List of comprehensive DeFi Admin API’s

For a full list of all the API’s provided, please see documentation [here](https://buf.build/avantgardefinance/enzyme/docs/main:enzyme.enzyme.v1#enzyme.enzyme.v1.EnzymeService.GetAssetList).&#x20;
