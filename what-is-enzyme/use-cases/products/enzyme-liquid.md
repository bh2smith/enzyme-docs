# Enzyme Liquid

Enzyme Liquid is powered byEnzyme that enables early stage projects to attract users and liquidity pre or post launch. The product has the following features:

### Pre-launch TVL

Enzyme Liquid allows early birds to pledge early capital to the DeFi protocol. This pledged capital is held in a smart Vault and is systematically deposited as liquidity to your DeFi protocol once it has launched. This will occur through a custom integration which is audited independently.&#x20;



### Custody

Enzyme Liquid is a completely non-custodial solution on-chain. This means that depositors can opt out at any time and view activity transparently on-chain. The Vaults can be  pre-programmed by you in such a way that assets can only be directed to one specific cause programmatically and this should be easily visible to users on-chain.



### Incentive Program Tooling

Early support can be encouraged with incentive programs. The Enzyme Liquid team can help you curate a liquidity mining program. Enzyme Liquid provides tooling to calculate rewards accrued to users in real-time which can easily be displayed on your interface with our API tooling.

### White Labelled interface

Enzyme Liquid comes with an out-of the box whitelabelling toolkit which you can use to accept deposits and monitor rewards.  If you prefer a more native integration, Turbo can provide an SDK toolkit for you to quickly integrate a range of widgets to choose from with different functionality. These widgets can be quickly integrated to your website natively with support from our team.

### Aligned Governance Token

Instead of using or issuing your own native token as a governance token, consider using the early liquidity Vault token as your governance token. This ensures that those participating in your governance actually have skin in the game.

### Cross-chain deposits (coming soon)

Enzyme Liquid is working on making early support available from a range of different blockchains. Why alienate an audience? This will vastly expand your biz-dev opportunities and make asset gathering quick and easy.\


Crucially, Enzyme Liquid frees the team from distraction and allows them to focus on core value-adding activities. Once the DeFi project is finally ready for launch, the assets can be diverted towards liquidity on your DeFi protocol ensuring a successful day one launch.
