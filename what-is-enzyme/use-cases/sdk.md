# SDK

The Enzyme SDK is a TypeScript library that allows you to interact with the Enzyme protocol on-chain. It includes abstractions around and utilities for interacting with the full range of the vast Enzyme smart contract landscape: Vault creation, configuration and maintenance, portfolio management, deposits, withdrawals, value and price calculations and more.

The SDK can be found [here](https://github.com/enzymefinance/sdk), with [user docs](https://enzymefinance.github.io/sdk/overview/) available here. Please bare in mind the user docs are still a WIP.&#x20;
