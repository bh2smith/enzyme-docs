# Browsing Vault Information

Once you've narrowed your search of promising vaults, clicking into the “View Details” button on the vault you want to investigate further will give you a wealth of information. It can be divided broadly into three sections. Before we get into those however, note that all numbers displayed on this page are measured in the currency you've selected in the settings menu in the top right corner of the screen.

### Overview

The top portion of the vault overview page shows you its performance over time, as well as some basic headline information.

The drop-down menu in the top right corner of the chart allows you to show the product's share price or its assets under management. The monthly return table breaks out the performance of the share price into monthly increments (against the currency of your choosing).

### Portfolio

### **Financials**
